int is a primitive data type while Integer is a class within the Java.lang.Number package. Integer is a wrapper class for integer values, which gives us more options in how to store or manipulate an int data. Using the primitive data type int can be quick and efficient, since it requires much less memory than using objects of type Integer and we can access it directly instead of through a pointer to an object. If the variable you are declaring fits within the constrictions of the int data type and you only want to perform basic operations with it, int is the way to go. Integer gives us the ability to perform more than just the basic operations that we can with an int. We can call methods like reverse() and rotateLeft() on top of the basic arithmetic operations we can perform on an int variable. Several other methods are given in the Integer class that can be helpful. You can perform conversions from ints to Strings and a String to an Integer.
